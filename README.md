<img width="1918" height="957" alt="screencapture-kvrae-github-io-Kav-man-2025-10-27-13_51_43" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d1511704-249e-4e35-8a59-3bb1fe8a18fa" />


This is a simple grid-based Pac‑Man clone implemented with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript. It's intentionally small so you can learn from it and extend it.

How to run
1. Save the files in a folder: `index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser (double-click or use an HTTP server).
3. Use arrow keys to move Pac‑Man.

What the code contains
- Grid represented by an array (layout).
- Walls, dots, power pellets, Pac‑Man start, ghost starts.
- Simple ghost movement (random) and frightened mode when Pac‑Man eats a power pellet.
- Score, lives, win/lose states.

Ideas to extend
- Add sprite images and mouth animation.
- Improve ghost AI (Blinky, Pinky, Inky, Clyde behavior).
- Add levels and more complex maps.
- Add mobile touch controls.
- Add sounds for eating dots, power pellets, death, and victory.

Enjoy hacking on it — tell me what feature you'd like next (smooth movement, improved ghosts, touch support, or sound) and I’ll add it.
